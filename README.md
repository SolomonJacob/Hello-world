# Heading 1

this is the first repository that i have made

This is another heading

To make a new heading use #.

 This should be size 18

 This is now a paragraph with a different backgruond colour

 This paragraph should be in the middle.


```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Cell 1 | Cell 2
Cell 3 | Cell 4


<p>this is a test paragraph to see if it works</p>
